--- 2025-09-04T07:31:53.734Z warn
▲ [WARNING] Processing wrangler.toml configuration:

    - Unexpected fields found in build field: "upload"


---

--- 2025-09-04T07:31:53.738Z warn
▲ [WARNING] Multiple environments are defined in the Wrangler configuration file, but no target environment was specified for the deploy command.

  To avoid unintentional changes to the wrong environment, it is recommended to
  explicitly specify the target environment using the `-e|--env` flag.
  If your intention is to use the top-level environment of your configuration
  simply pass an empty string to the flag to target such environment. For
  example `--env=""`.
